                            Even before the initial pandemic, there were already 43,000 people living in family shelters in New York City in 2019, with about 25,000 of those people being children and teens. According to campaigners, the number of public school children suffering
                            housing instability has remained over 100,000 for the past five years, with nearly 111,000 kids experiencing homelessness for the 2019-2020 school year. As staggering as that number is, it represents a 2.2 percent drop from
                            the previous year. Eighty-five percent of students facing homelessness were Black or Hispanic.

                        <p>Before COVID-19, half of all renters were moderately or severely cost-burdened, with housing costs accounting for 30 to 50 percent of their household income. Renters who are tight on money, particularly those of color, are more
                            likely to be evicted due to a higher possibility of missing rent payments. People of color, who experienced greater rates of job loss during the pandemic, are disproportionately cost-burdened and at risk of eviction.

                            and once pushed into homelessness, families confront a "pileup of injustices." When secure shelter is unavailable, persons are frequently subjected to criminality as a result of anti-homeless legislation. They also face food
                            insecurity, deterioration in physical and mental health, and additional challenges in securing future homes.
